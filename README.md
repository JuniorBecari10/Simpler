# Simpler

Simpler is a compiled language, superset of [Simple](https://github.com/JuniorBecari10/Simple). <br>
It's also very easy to use. <br>

## Compiling

To compile a source file to Go _(the only supported language yet)_, type `simpler <source>`. <br>
To automatically run the code, type `simpler run <source>`. This command will compile the code, run it, and then delete it.
