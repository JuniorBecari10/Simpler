# Simpler

Simpler is a compiled language, superset of [Simple](https://github.com/JuniorBecari10/Simple). <br>
It's also very easy to use. <br>

## Compiling

You can choose the language Simpler will compile to. <br>
The available ones are the following:

- Go; _`default`_
- ~C~; _`not available yet.`_
- ~C++~. _`not available yet.`_

If you type `simpler run <source>` in the terminal, the default language will be chosen and the code will be automatically executed. Then, the file will be automatically deleted.

To choose the language, type: `simpler go|c|cpp <source>`. The language will generate a file with the same name as the source one in the chosen language.

To automatically run the code in a different language, type `simpler run go|c|cpp <source>`.
